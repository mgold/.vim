Max Goldstein - .vim directory

This folder contains the .vimrc configuration and my color scheme of choice (busybee.vim).

Features of the .vimrc:
* Expand tabs to four spaces
* Highlight and wrap lines longer than 80 characters
* One keystroke save and compile: = runs make if a Makefile is present, otherwise runs ./compile
* Tab mapped to auto-format (works best with C-like {}s)
* Sensible cursor movement around the ends of lines
* Save a shift: swap ; and :, _ and -
* jj enters normal mode from insert mode  
* Disable arrow keys in normal mode, to force the use of hjkl
* Spacebar inserts one character and then return to normal mode
* Enter makes a newline
* Disable annoying keys you'll never mean to strike

Python-specific (.py files only):
* Dark columns every four spaces help align code (Vim 7.3+ only)
* Tab indents line; Shift-tab unindents
* No text wrap
* Save and run the current file with = (unless it can run ./compile)

There is a symbolic link in my home folder to the .vimrc here. If you're willing to wipeout your exising vim configuration and replace it with mine, use 
cd;rm -rf .vim;git clone git://github.com/mgold/.vim.git;rm .vimrc;ln -s .vim/.vimrc .vimrc
